<h1>Welcome to freeOpenML project</h1>
First let me apologize for my english but I'm not a native english
speaker (I'm French ^_^ and it's well known that French are bad at
English ^_^)<br>
<br>
<br>
freeOpenML is a 'fork' of OpenML standard from khronos group<br>
the main goal is to provide a K.I.S.S compatible framework with no
dependencies upon some IRIX part<br>
<h2>why a "fork"</h2>
<ul>
  <li>why not? ^_^</li>
  <li>OpenML sdk contain proeminent notice about IRIX dependencies,
althought it's GPL this might lead to issue</li>
  <li>OpenML sdk was to complex</li>
  <li>I wanted to make a fast library, so fast that overhead on small
systems won't be noticeable</li>
  <li>I first wanted to use posix Messages Queues but after some work
OpenML don't allow efficient use of MQ....</li>
  <li>I had enough of those lame type redefinition : enough of
ML_INT32, GINT, Q... : what garanty us that copying a ML_INT32 to a GINT
will work.... C standard has enough type to confuse the user. why adding
another?</li>
  <li>your library isn't portable etc.... : YES it isn't.... I don't
mind making it portable if portability means loss of
functionalities..... look at gtk+, QT.... there portable yes... but far
less powerfull than the Xlib..... I don't mind porting my application on
slow ass systems, what's the point of having a fast as light framework
if the system behind is too slow to take advantage of the lightweight?
it's like having a grandtourismo car driver on a citroen 2Cv? <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE INTERNAL OF THE SDK</h1>
and in particular it will describes the behaviour <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"device
driver" writer MUST follow</span><br>
<br>
<h2>GOALS</h2>
the main goal is to keep the things _simple_ with minimizing
incompatibilities<br>
with OpenML standards and *NIX standards (see incompabilities below)<br>
the "obvious" issue is the portability on MS OSes but I think that the
performance issue created by the portability (can't use shared memory
directly without creating a layer upon , which means performance loss)
are more important<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> _THIS_IS_A_OPENMLike_FOR_*NIX_</span><br>
<br>
<h2>Driver writers</h2>
basically a driver writer will :<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">use
C99 standard type</span> (not the ML* types) a header is provided to keep
compatibility with the standard.</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">use
POSIX/XOpen standard</span> and nothing else (except for special
case....) the developpers will try to keep the drivers as close as
possible to the standard</li>
  <li>we will use <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">GNU indentation
standard</span> (use indent if you don't want) every CVS, patch should
be in this format. (give it a try, it's oriented toward lisibility, not
like the BSD one), tabulation will be 2 char long (this is well suited
with GNU coding style)</li>
  <li>&nbsp;sources will be<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">80 col wide</span>...
the purpose of doing that is to keep a coding standard that every
developper can read.... remember : you're not alone</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">try
to use eXtrem Programming methods</span> when possible : you should begin
by coding the tests (this will make you think how to code the function)
and then the function, make the test run and when everything is ok,
commit it ^_^</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">be
K.I.S.S. compatible</span> (Keep It Simple, Stupid) : you MUST keep the
code as simple as possible (no try to make it generic), this ensure that
further modification of the code will be easely made.. (see eXtrem
Programming methods that explain this in details)</li>
  <li>Increment the code step by step : begin by making the
"minimalistic" working code (and before the associated test), test it,
commit it, modify the test to include enhancement, modify the code, test
it.... this ensure no regression and that the code remain simple (which
garanties that the further modifications will be easely made).</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">every memory that will
be shared(buffers...) must be POSIX shared memory</span>, this because
the application can be clustered across multiple process, which can be
run through scripts. this implies that the memory will be pagesize
granurality</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">every memory is
constituted of two parts </span>: a semaphore and the data, this for
sharing semaphores across processes.</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">take whenever possible
advantages of posix realtime extensions </span>(what is the point of
having a "portable realtime" if we consume cpu on the "compatibility
layer" ?)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">always
set the buffer alignement requirement to a page,</span> this is for
having the following improvements : if a transcoder don't need to change
the buffer size (maybe because it don't modify the data type but only
modify them) or if the outputed data fits into the buffer, then the
buffers will be shared, some devices can be hardware ones and then have
dma's which have to be page aligned (because the system has to lock the
pages into memory to prevent swapping), then mmap() aware devices
produce pages aligned datas....</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">always set timing
informations </span>: the method given by OML is rather clever since it
intrinsecly supports multiframe rates.... if you provide timings
informations.... if you don't care about such information, simply pass
the information on the output queue.</li>
  <li>IDs are 64bits, we will have those devided as follow :</li>
  <ul>
    <li>16 bits for systems, 16 for devices, 32 others are used for
mlGetCapabilities and left to devices discretion.....</li>
    <li>O_O no ID for paths, xcodes, pipes? no, because they will use
separate way to be handled : on open, a device will fork/threads up a
new "handler", this handler will open two messages queues (in and out)
which are used to communicate with the device, the open layer will open
the MQs on behalf of the process, and return an MLopenid struct to the
process (this contain the two MQ descriptors) doing so ensure that we
won't need other id anymore : we talk to the process/thread directly,
without using a layer..... this means too that a XCODE can use several
id without bothering with "id space polution"</li>
  </ul>
  <li>each "TODO" will be put into a #warning so as it's easy to track
the Todo remaining</li>
  <li>see testcases directory for tests and driver/mlforward.c for a
driver template</li>
  <li>howto debug a test ? don't forget to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
the current lib build localisation and run ddd ^_^</li>
  <li>use errno significations...... <br>
  </li>
  <li>use Mesa (www.mesa3d.org) has "effect" library for soft plugins :
 <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>it'll reduce the overhead to port the plugin to a hardware
accelerated one</li>
    <li>it'll produce higher quality than rewriting a plugin.</li>
    <li>it'll increase portability</li>
    <li>it'll reduce test overhead, debugging....</li>
    <li>side effect : ^_^ modify mesa to use drm/dri without X.... the
one that achieve this will help the whole communauty so much.... because
we'll be able to perform hardware accelerated stuff without X..... and
because at this time dri is only available on the same X11, dri isn't
possible on remote ones, for those libmesa is used, if libmesa is able
to perform dri....<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>PLUGINS</h2>
plugins will follow the following rules :<br>
<ul>
  <li>use enqueue/dequeue without copy</li>
  <li>store return status of a sendbuffer/sendparam/sendmessage into
the length field of the ML_END message part. <br>
  </li>
  <li>the param field of ML_END MUST not be modified since it's used to
create the liste of messages</li>
  <li>request page aligned data, althought this brings more complexity
to user application, this ensure that every plugin on every system will
be compatible, regardless of hardware/ software type, then the
complexity brought by the page alligment is lowered by the fact that the
application don't need to bother about the different plugins chaining :
every buffer allocated by any plugin can be used as IO of another.</li>
  <li>mlClose will ensure that no more buffers are on in queue and that
every message that haven't been processed have a return status ECANCELED</li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>incompabilities</h2>
the project isn't limited to the OpenML standard and then it'll try to
extend the openML standards for the followings points:<br>
<ul>
  <li>transcoder are mutipaths transcoders (because most FX require
this) the "standard" feature is still supported</li>
  <li>if you look into chapter 6 of the standard you'll see that
transcoders have fields&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XCODE_SRC_PIPE_IDS and
XCODE_DEST_PIPE_IDS so for multistreams we will use
thoses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exemple a "merging" transcoder will read on
XCODE_SRC_PIPE_ID 0 and 1 and output on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
XCODE_DEST_PIPE_ID 2&nbsp; (those id are internal ids it's recommended
to use UST and MSC into buffer provided to transcoders so rates can be
dynamically modified.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;we will maybe provide audio api... but I think that the
OpenAL is more powerfull than the limited openML....</li>
  <li>use of FOURCC for xcode, bacward compatibilities is provided</li>
  <li>MLpv struct has a new field "offset" that can be used to pass an
offset into a buffer enqueued</li>
  <li>ML_STATUS_SEND_QUEUE_OVERFLOW and
ML_STATUS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_OVERFLOW are the same, application must check
all queues (in and out) to determine where it comes from...... on
current implementation such error will never happens....</li>
  <li>ML_CONTROLS_COMPLETE&nbsp; == ML_BUFFERS_COMPLETE ==
ML_QUERY_CONTROLS_COMPLETE ==ML_MESSAGE_COMPLETE &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
ML_CONTROLS_ABORTED ==&nbsp; ML_BUFFERS_ABORTED ==
ML_QUERY_CONTROLS_ABORTED == ML_MESSAGE_ABORTED<br>
ML_CONTROLS_FAILED&nbsp; == ML_BUFFERS_FAILED ==
ML_QUERY_CONTROLS_FAILED&nbsp; == ML_MESSAGE_FAILED<br>
  </li>
  <li>mlInit (&amp;argc , &amp;argv) has to be called before using the
library, this will load the plugins in ML_PLUGINS_PATH environnement
variable or default to /usr/lib/mlplugins</li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">additionnal API&nbsp; </span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>mlSendMessageNoCopy (MLopenid id, MLpv* buffers) : send a
message without copying it, for faster communication<br>
    </li>
    <li>mlFreeMessage(MLpv* capabilities) : free allocated space for a
message...... (same as mlFreeCapabilities)</li>
    <li>ajout des types int16 et int16* dans MLpv</li>
    <li>mlSelectPipe(MLopenid id, u_int64_t pipeId) : select a pipe to
read/write from/to, the send/receive message mechanism will work as a
state machine, ie you must select the pipe you want to send to before
doing an mlsend, the same apply to reading pipes. Exemple : <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 160px;">mlSelectPipe(openID, PIPE1);<br>
mlSendMessageNoCopy(openID, someMessage);<br>
mlSelectPipe(openID, PIPE2);<br>
mlSendMessageNoCopy(openID, someMessage);</div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;">will send the message someMessage to
both pipes '1' and '2',&nbsp; the pipeID paparm is the id you get in
GetCapabilities XCODE_SRC_PIPE_IDS like fields<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm thinking of removing the concept of paths because they are
the same as a jack : a jack has only one paths and vice-versa.... and
there is always the issue of "binding" an path to a jack, like binding a
pipe to a transcoder (that has been solved with mlSelectPipe).....</li>
    <li>you can't open a path, or a pipe only a physical device can be
opened, capabilities though can be accessed regardless the type.</li>
    <li>mlAllocateBuffer(size_t size) : allocate an page aligned,
sharable memory, with a semaphore initialised at head of if (struct
buffer in mlbuffers.h), size is the size of the data, size of the
semaphore will be added.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> each message sent with "mlSend*" will be copied, on return of the
message the associated copy should be desalocated with mlFreeMessage (or
mlFreeCapabilities)</li>
</ul>
so basically the idea is "not too far from standard execpt when the
standard is too lame" ^_^<br>
<br>
<h2>TODO</h2>
see #warning at compile time to figure out what is needed<br>
<br>
help is welcome ^_^ :<br>
<ul>
  <li>need transcoding device (RGB -&gt;UYV) both harware and software</li>

<ul>
  <li>remove all warning ^_^<br>
  </li>
</ul>
and don't forget : make a test for each plugin before writing the
plugin ^_^<br>
<br>
remember that the "rules" set on the developpement of the project
aren't set only by pleasure (I, personnaly, don't like the 80 char
limit). I tried to make the rules as simple as possible, this for
helping sharing the knowledge.<br>
*NIX rocks ^_^<br>
<h1><a href="againstautotools.html">why autotools sucks</a><br>
</h1>
<h1>absolute timestamps sucks! args like answer :</h1>
yes I know first try of most players is to use relative timestamps :
that's true this is the logical behaviour but not the best one....<br>
why? because of "SIGSTOP" "SIGCONT" that permits to suspend and resume
a process<br>
look : in order to output frames in time we need 4 parameters : the
timestamp of the previous frame(TS1), the timestamp of the current
frame(TS2) and the clock of the last output(LST), the current clock(CUR).<br>
when a new frame is provided we need to check the time that must elapse
between the 2 frame : TS2 -TS1 = TimeToWait<br>
next we must determine the obsolute time elapsed : CUR-LST=TimeElapsed<br>
if TimeToWait&lt;TimeElapsed we must output the frame<br>
using this approach allow to abstract ourselve of the concept of FPS or
framerate : you can change abritrarly the FPS during a video without
bothering<br>
of course the use of this method is only usefull for palyed/transcoding
like applications because it's highly inefficient for the file
size/seeking time in file (like the windows media stuff ) : it's easier
to store only fps change than each timestamp.....<br>
BUT for playback this is really usefull.<br>
<br>
yes.... yes.... but why ABSOLUTE ones? lets take an exemple with
relative timestamp (0:0.0 is the first frame, the delay in the pipe
[time taked between the frame is puted into the pipe by the input plugin
and time at which the frame is outputed] is 1:0.0 for simplicity )<br>

for the 3 1rst frame there is no problem : even if the delay in the
pipe isn't regular the output will have no sync issue<br>
but looking more closely the SIGSTOP/SIGCONT behaviour :<br>
the ouput plugin calculate the time elapsed (a stoped process don't
know that he was stoped) : 19:25.7-16:25.2 = 3:0.5<br>
it calculate the TimeToWait : 0:0.1.... OUPS we are&nbsp; in a hurry!
what to do? what to do? DROP! DROP! DROP!&nbsp; and since usually it
keeps tracks of the delay remaining [this is the correct behaviour,
thinking 1/2s will give you the reason] it'll drop frame until it regain
syncs, this means it'll drop 3:0.5 video..... this is like if the
pausing wanted by the user has not occured : the frames between 0:0.3 to
3:0.8 are discarded..... <br>
<br>
why the absolute times solve the issue?

3 1rst frames : ok no pb, left as an exercice ^_^<br>
<br>
TimeToWait :&nbsp; 18:25.7-15:25.2 = 3:0.5<br>
TimeElapsed : 19:25.2-19:25.7=3:0.5<br>
ok this is solved, no need to enter the "hurry! DROP!DROP!" mode to
keep the synchro ^_^<br>
<br>
the first exemple was take from an helix behaviour......<br>
<br>
of course this create additionnal complexity on imput plugin :<br>
the input plugin, before outputing a frame in the pipe, must read the
absolute clock, compare it with previous output time and with the file
informations <br>
typically :<br>
TimeToOutput=(Curr+TimeToWait) rounded to TimeToWait granurality<br>
<br>
ex : TTO=(19:25.759+0:0.1)%0:0.1=19:25.8<br>
in fact doing this is really simple : <br>
you know the fps, so you know that the frame should be outputed every
100ms (exemple) so everytimestamp you create should be of a granularity
of 100ms, since the delay in the pipe is already handled by the absolute
timestamp mechanism, you don't need to overprecise the timestamp : a
timestamp of 19:25.3 is a timestamp of 19:25.254 with a delay of 46....
as long as you remain coherent in all the processing, you can timestamp
your frames almost like you want, provided you only touch the second
and ms part of the timestamp. remember : as long as you remain coherent.<br>
<br>
<br>
of course this don't garanty frame rate if resources are low.... but
who can garanty realtime on a too slow hardware?<br>
one way is to mark the frame as "droppable" and then avoid having all
the process done, which save CPU.... but this is the work of the
application, not of the framework<br>
this a point in favor to OpenML&nbsp; : the application can remove a
device from the pipe without breaking all the pipe because there is no
"automatic" scheduling, nor piped data : an fx that don't transform the
data format can safely be desactivated by not feeding it, saving cpu.....<br>
