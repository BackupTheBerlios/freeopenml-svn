<h1>why not using libtool/automake/autoconf/pkgconfig</h1>
yes I know libtool/automake/autoconf rocks! as long as you don't try
something special, else you'll run into trouble shortly...... I left
windows world because of such behaviour... here follow some outoforder
args<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>automake : as long you try only to make things said in info
pages, it works well, but if you want to do fancy things / debug
automake output because what you do don't work, you have to learn about
makefile/make....&nbsp; why learn 2 typo? make is more powerfull and
learning it make you write small clean Makefile that can easely be
extended (look at freeOpenML makefiles..... in less than 1 page I can
perform automatic dependency tracking, library building, custom make
output message [even colorized ones ^_^] ....)</li>
  <li>autoconf : same args as above : you'll need to learn autoconf
typo, sh scripts..... people often do scripts that do nothing not even
fail on missing header..... <br>
  </li>
  <li>automake/autoconf : produce a lot of files that do the same thing</li>
  <li>autoconf : too slow, fancy autoconf script are hard to debug or
to read/extend</li>
  <li>libtool : produce .la file that are text, in those file libtool
store path,&nbsp; library dependency... (for system unlike GNU one that
can't track library dependency) but when you try to make crosscompiling
things, you'll only end seding those file because they use fixed
paths.....</li>
  <li>libtool : versionning mechanism isn't logical, a logical one
should be : <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>CURRENT:AGE:REVISION</li>
    <li>source code improvement : REVISION++</li>
    <li>on interface addition : AGE++, REVISION=0</li>
    <li>interface removal/change : CURRENT++, AGE=0, REVISION=0</li>
    <ul>
      <li>doing so garanties that a program can safely link with
libraries with same CURRENT, Greater AGE, greater REVISION</li>
    </ul>
    <li>and more : this keep the package version scheme usually used
.... <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>pkgconfig : same as above.... this is NOT K.I.S.S</li>
  <ul>
    <li>don't support environnement variable..... <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
